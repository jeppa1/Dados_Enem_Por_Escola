# ENEM School Data Analysis Project üìä

This project focuses on the **structuring and exploratory analysis of Brazilian high school performance data from the ENEM (Exame Nacional do Ensino M√©dio) between 2005 and 2015. The dataset was restructured following technical coding standards to allow for statistical and visual analysis.

## üîç Key Features:
- **Data Structuring:** Raw data from INEP was restructured into a standardized format with variables renamed as Q1, Q2, ..., Q24.
- **Metadata Documentation:** A metadata worksheet was created to describe each variable, its type, and its operational coding.
- **Statistical Descriptive Analysis:** Mean, median, quartiles, standard deviation, and missing values were analyzed for quantitative variables like `Q18` (average score), `Q22` (approval rate), `Q23` (rejection rate), and `Q24` (dropout rate).
- **Exploratory Data Visualization:** Histograms, boxplots, and stacked bar charts were generated to explore patterns across school characteristics such as administrative dependency (`Q8`), school size (`Q10`), and location (`Q9`).

## üßæ Variables:
Each variable was renamed according to the following code:
- `Q1`: Year (`NU_ANO`)
- `Q2`: School UF Code (`CO_UF_ESCOLA`)
- `Q3`: School UF Initial (`SG_UF_ESCOLA`)
- `Q8`: Administrative Dependency Type (1=Federal, 2=State, 3=Municipal, 4=Private)
- `Q9`: Location (1=Urban, 2=Rural)
- `Q10`: School Size (1=1‚Äì30 students, 2=31‚Äì60, 3=61‚Äì90, 4=>90 students)
- `Q18`: Average Total Score
- `Q22`: Approval Rate (%)
- `Q23`: Rejection Rate (%)
- `Q24`: Dropout Rate (%)

## üìä Results:
- **Average total scores** show differences by management type, with private schools performing better on average.
- **Approval and dropout rates** also vary significantly across regions and school types.
- **School size vs. location** indicates that urban schools are more likely to be large institutions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
- Google Sheets (data structuring and documentation)
- Python (Pandas, GSpread, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab

This project follows best practices in data structuring, descriptive statistics, and data visualization, aligning with academic content on descriptive statistics, categorical variables, and data quality assurance.
